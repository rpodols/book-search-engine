# MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine - Challenge 21

## Description
This project is the twenty-first challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As an avid reader, I want to search for new books to read, so that I can keep a list of books to purchase.

Starting from the initial commit, this challenge required writing code to do the following:
*   GIVEN a book search engine

        - WHEN I load the search engine
        - THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

        - WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option
        - THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a 
        submit button

        - WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
        -THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the 
        Google Books site

        - WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option
        - THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up

        - WHEN the toggle is set to Signup
        - THEN I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button

        - WHEN the toggle is set to Login
        - THEN I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button

        - WHEN I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button
        - THEN my user account is created and I am logged in to the site

        - WHEN I enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button
        - THEN I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site

        - WHEN I am logged in to the site
        - THEN the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout

        - WHEN I am logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
        - THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account

        - WHEN I click on the Save button on a book
        - THEN that book’s information is saved to my account

        - WHEN I click on the option to see my saved books
        - THEN I am presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account

        - WHEN I click on the Remove button on a book
        - THEN that book is deleted from my saved books list

        - WHEN I click on the Logout button
        - THEN I am logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
